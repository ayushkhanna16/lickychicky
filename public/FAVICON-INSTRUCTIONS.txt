COUPLE PHOTO AS FAVICON
======================

To use a photo of you and your girlfriend as the site favicon (the small icon in the browser tab):

1. Choose a clear photo of the two of you (square or nearly square works best).

2. Save it in this folder (public/) with one of these names:
   - couple-photo.jpg
   - couple-photo.png

3. The site is already set to use it. If both files exist, the .jpg is used first.

4. Restart or refresh the dev server (npm run dev) after adding the file.

Recommended: Use a square crop (e.g. 512×512 or 256×256) so it looks good as a small icon.
